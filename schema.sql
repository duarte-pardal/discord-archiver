-- In the snapshot tables, making the primary key be (id, _timestamp), in that order, allows SQLite to find
-- all snapshots for a given object and a specific snapshot for a given object faster.

-- Common columns:
--   * _timestamp: Contains the UNIX timestamp of when the snapshot was taken in bits 1-63 and the
--     least significant bit indicates if the snapshot was taken in reaction to a gateway event
--     (1 if it was, 0 if not). The special value 0 indicates that the snapshot depicts the state
--     of the object when it was created (e.g. snapshot taken in reaction to a create event).
--   * _deleted: Contains the UNIX timestamp of when the first snapshot where the object was found
--     to be deleted was taken in bits 1-63 and the least significant bit indicates if the
--     deletion was caught in a gateway event. NULL if it wasn't deleted.
--   * _extra: Contains fields that have no corresponding column in the table, in JSON. This is
--     used when encountering unknown fields. Some known fields are always stored in this column.
